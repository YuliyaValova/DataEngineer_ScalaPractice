# DataEngineer_ScalaPractice
## Functionality
It is a Scala application that:
- Connects to the DB2 instance on the cloud
- Generates a table with 20k of sample records
   - product_id - autogenerated numeric
   - product_group - autogenerated numeric in 0..9 range
   - year - autogenerated numeric in 2015..2018 range
   - 12 columns with monthly purchases amount - numeric in 0..100000 range
   - There should be no duplicates for the same product/year
   - If there are multiple product rows for different years, product/group combination should be concise

| Name | Version |
| ------ | ------ |
